Dataset: MIMIC III

In order to gain access to the MIMIC datasets you must first complete an application process. After becoming approved, you then complete the required CITI training, then one final approval after submitting required training completion certificates. The process is straight forward and instructions are provided at the bottom of the [MIMIC Repository](https://physionet.org/content/mimiciv/2.2/).
It would be beneficial to allocate around 5-7 days for this process. Cleaned data files will be held locally and cannot be publically accessable.
