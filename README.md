# Parallel Project --- HealthData Insights: Enhancing Healthcare through EHR Analysis with BigQuery and Spark

Electronic health records (EHRs) are used widely in the whole world in nowadays, it provides a comprehensive view of a patient's basic information (age, gender) and medical history (family history, allergies, tests resultsâ€¦), then providing critical information for clinical judgment, research, and healthcare management. With the introduction of many cloud computing and big data technologies, there has been a significant progress in analyzing EHR data. This project will complete the usage of machine learning (ML) approaches in Google Cloud BigQuery and Apache Spark, two powerful high-performance computing (HPC) platforms on EHR data, to predict the likelihood that a patient will have a disease at a certain time in the future. Through leveraging the parallel processing, real-time analytics, and ML tools provided by HPC platforms, healthcare professionals and data scientists can discover existing hidden patterns, improve patient care and treatment, and promote medical research. This paper will explore various aspects of the features and benefits of these platforms and compare the predictive accuracy of ML models for EHR data.
